E-commerce Transactional Performance and Reporting 📈

This final project analyzed a transactional sales dataset, focusing on revenue drivers and profitability. Python (Pandas/NumPy) was central to data filtering, cleaning, and calculating KPIs like Total Revenue and Average Order Value (AOV). Matplotlib produced categorical performance charts, while Excel was utilized to build a dynamic and beautiful dashboard, allowing stakeholders to interactively filter data and derive insights on product and payment mode performance.
